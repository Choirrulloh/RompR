# Customising the Interface

Romp–Ø allows you to customise the interface with different options:
* Theme defines colours and background.
* Icons can be chosen from white, black, colourful, or iconfont.
* A range of different font styles can be used
* The font size can be changed

This is Numismatist, the default theme, using the 'Modern-Dark' icons

And this is Darkness, using the 'Modern-Light' icons

Some themes use a background image

If you use a theme with a background image, you can change the image to one of your own from the configuration panel

Use 'Browse' to select the image then click 'Upload'. To remove your image and revert to the default, click the x.

Note that some of the fonts used are taken from Google Fonts and therefore require an internet connection to work. All have sensible fallbacks, just in case.

## Making Your Own Theme

You can make your own theme if you know some CSS. Just take a copy of one of the existing ones from

    rompr/themes
    
and edit the values. Give yours a different name, refresh the browser window, and you can select it from the menu.
