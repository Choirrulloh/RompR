The Desktop skin is the default if you're accessing Romp–Ø from a browser on a desktop computer or laptop.

At the top left are the play controls. These are (left to right)
* Previous Track
* Play/Pause
* Stop
* Stop After Current Track
* Next Track

Next to those is a vertical slider which is the volume control. The icon underneath it is a mute button when you're using Mopidy or using mpd with only one audio output. When you're using mpd with multiple audio outputs this button opens a menu allowing you to enable or disable the outputs.

Next to those is the Now Playing panel. This shows information about the currently playing track - the album image, track title, album name, and artist. Also the Rating, Tags, Playcount, and a Last.FM 'Love' button (if you're logged in to Last.FM)

Underneath that on the left is the Music Sources panel. You choose different sources using the icons at the top. These are (left to right):
* Music Collection
* Search
* File Browser
* Internet Radio
* Podcasts
* Saved Playlists
* Personalised Radio

In the centre is the Info Panel. The icons across the top are (left to right)
* Open Drop-Down-Menu of plugins - this is where things like the Ratings and Tags manager, Playlist Manager, etc can be found
* History
* Back (Info Panel)
* Forward (Info Panel)
* File Information
* Last.FM Info
* Wikipedia
* Musicbrainz
* Discogs
* Lyrics
* Soundcloud
* Spotify
* Youtube

On the right-hand side is the Current Playlist. Above that are various tools. These are (left to right):
* Sleep Timer
* Alarm Clock
* Album Art Manager
* Configuration Menu
* Save Current Playlist

The lower panels can be resized by dragging their edges, or hidden using the 'double arrow' icons.
