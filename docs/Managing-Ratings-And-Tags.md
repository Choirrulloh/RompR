# Managing Ratings And Tags
The Tags and Ratings manager can be opened from the dropdown menu above the Info panel, or in the top bar on the Phone skin.

This allows you to display your tagged and rated tracks sorted by different criteria, either by Rating, Tag, Tag List, or Artist. 'Tag List' means you get a separate panel for each *combination* of tags present in your Collection.

You can amend tags and ratings for any track - click the ratings stars to change the rating, click the x to remove a tag, or the + to add new tags.

You can add tags or ratings to any track by dragging it from the Collection, Search Results, or the Playlist onto the appropriate panel.

You can also add tracks to the Playlist by double-clicking them.

If you enter something in the 'Filter' box then only racks whose titles match that term will be displayed.

The Wastebasked icon on the right will remove that tag from all tracks.
