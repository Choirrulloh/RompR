# Browser Compatibility

As web technologies are generally based on good standards, Rompr should work in most browsers. But some companies, notably Microsoft, plough their own furrows and tend to be late in adopting standards.

## List of Browsers

* Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera - recent versions all supported and tested
* iOS - iOS 7 and above
* Android - Android 4.0 and above
* Internet Explorer, Edge - not supported. I have no way to test on these browsers and no way to fix bugs. Microsoft are not good at following web standards and I can't justify the expense of buying a Windows computer just for this.
