# Browser Compatibility

As web technologies are generally based on good standards, Rompr should work in most browsers. But some companies, notably Microsoft, plough their own furrows and tend to be late in adopting standards.

## List of Browsers

* Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera - recent versions all supported and tested
* iOS - iOS 7 and above
* Android - Android 4.0 and above
* Internet Explorer, Edge - not supported. There are reports that Rompr works in Edge on Windoes 10 but I can't confirm this. I have no way to test on these browsers and Microsoft are not good at following web standards. I can't justify the expense of buying a Windows computer just for a bit of testing so if it works, it works. If it doesn't, well just install another browser. They're all shite in one way or another.
