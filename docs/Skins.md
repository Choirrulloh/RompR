# Skins

RompЯ has multiple 'skins' that change the looks and layout of the interface.

* [Desktop](/RompR/Desktop-Skin) is the default skin on desktop devices. It is the one that most of the example images in these docs are taken from.
* [Phone](/RompR/Phone-Skin) is the default skin on small screens. It is optimised more for touchscreens.
* [Fruit](/RompR/Fruit-Skin) is an alternative skin intended for desktop devices, with a slightly different look intended to give more space to the Info panel.

A default skin will be chosen the first time you open RompR but you can change it at any time from the Configuration menu.

You can also select a skin when you open RompЯ by adding its name to the end of the url in your browser, like this:

    http://ip.address.of.rompr/?skin=phone
