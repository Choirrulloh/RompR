# Using Multiple Players

RompЯ supports using multiple players, which can be on different computers. You could have one in each room of your house to create a multi-room audio setup.

All the players can be used simultaneously, but they will not play in sync. The idea is that a person in one room can use one player and a person in another room can use a different player. All the players share the same Music Collection so Playcounts, Podcasts, Tags, Ratings, etc are shared across all of them.

You can add new players from the configuration menu. This opens a dialog box.

To select a player to use, just select it in the Configuration menu and that browser will use it whenever you open RompЯ.

Remember that 'localhost' in a player definition means 'the computer running the web server'.

If you're using players that are on different computers from the web server you should also read [this guide](/RompR/Troubleshooting).
