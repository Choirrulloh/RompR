# RompЯ
This is a browser-based client for Mopidy and MPD, which are both music players.

You can use RompЯ to control a music player on another device or on your computer. Because it runs in a web browser you can run it ony any device - your laptop,tablet, or phone can all be used to control your music player.
It has a rich and beautiful interface which is intended to sort your music, manage radio stations, browse and subscribe to podcasts.
When used with Mopidy you can listen to Spotify and make use of RompЯ's incredible music discovery features which will help to introduce you to new music.

The source code is now hosted here on github but the project home is still at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/rompr/
at least for the time being - you should go there to download the latest release and get installation instructions. In the fullness of time I expect this to become the new project home.

If you'd like to install from Here, there are instructions for various methods on the [Wiki here on Github][https://github.com/fatg3erman/RompR/wiki]
